Special information about Inha!

### More Information

I would like to be PM(Product Manager).
That's why i study both of programming language and plan management.

I'm quite inquisitive. I am wondering how the world is. Especially, How do people organize and live. I hope to widen my view. The experience is different from the theory. I want to manage my life with racially mixed students, communicate with them, broaden my range of experiences and enjoy cultures. 

Talking with other people leads to various direction. The key how to reach good decision is hidden in all the sum of our present. I hope our experience will come together at the moment of future choice. I wish living on my own makes me encourage my independence and inner growth.

You could call me Nina or Inha.
Now I'm studying with @JNU-econovation
